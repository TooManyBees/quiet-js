<p>
  Hop on a voice chat with your friends. One person join a random room on this site, then share the link. The first person to click <em>Start game</em> takes the first turn. The game will shuffle a deck of 52 or 36 cards for you.
</p>

<p>
  On your turn, click <em>Draw card</em> to draw a card. No one will see it except you, so announce it to the other players. When you're done, click <em>Pass turn</em>.
</p>

<p>
  The game will handle <span class="card">KING_DIAMONDS</span> and reducing project dice on its own. It's on the players to remove projects when appropriate.
</p>

<p>
  Anyone can draw, erase, or place projects at any time. Anyone can join the room at any time and get added to the turn order. Anyone can click <em>Pass turn</em> to end the current turn early and advance to the next player. The lack of guard rails is because this app is a facilitator, not a dungeon master. I only recommend playing with people you'd feel comfortable sitting across a table from.
