# The Socially Distanced Year

This is a web app to facilitate playing [The Quiet Year](https://buriedwithoutceremony.com/the-quiet-year) remotely with friends. It ain't associated with the game or its creator in the least.

This app will handle:
* Syncing a map between players
* Shuffling a deck of playing cards to draw from
* Positioning projects on the map, and counting down the weeks until they complete

The players are responsible for:
* Keeping track of resources, villagers, and contempt
* Removing projects when appropriate
* Looking up the in-game meanings of each card

## To Play

1. Visit [quiet.enbies.online](https://quiet.enbies.online). You'll get redirected to a random room.
1. Share the URL with friends. Anyone can join the room if they have the URL. The room will disappear if everyone leaves.
1. Get on voice or video chat to communicate. Use a shared text document to handle all the note taking during the game.
1. Hit *Start game* in the pop-out drawer in the bottom right of the screen.
1. Kinda just wing it from there.
